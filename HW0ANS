Create a new pull request containing a file that describes at minimum:

1. Intended platform for the final project (e.g. Android, iOS) 
Ans: I'll create an iOS app because my devices work on iOS. I think learning to create an app I can use on my devices will be a fun learning experience.

2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project (e.g. Kotlin, Swift). 
Ans: I currently intend to use Swift language and Swift UI framework for my app. Swift is the recommended language to use for new iOS app developers so that would be my primary choice. 
Swift UI works well with Swift so I'll choose it as my framework. Also, Swift UI offers a live preview feature.


3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development. 
Ans: If I build a functional iOS app and time allows it, I'll consider cross-platform development.
